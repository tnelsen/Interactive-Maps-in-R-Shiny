## Importance of interactivity for engagement and understanding

> [Interactive] "tools that can be used to engage stakeholders and help them understand and apply relevant dataâ€œ (Carls and Griffin, 2016)

Interactive tools are an engaging way to communicate data and concepts. Users can learn as they are doing how the different pieces fit together and what it means for their individual situation. Many groups in extension and science communication have started to recognize this but interactive tools are not being used in many places where they could be a perfect fit. 

Interactive maps in R shiny are open-source, customizable, and of professional-quality. They allow users to explore data, provide both spatial and non-spatial inputs, and receive personalized feedback.


## Example of what is possible with interactive maps in R shiny

[The Nitrogen Fertilizer Management Tool for California Wheat (Beta)](https://smallgrain-n-management.plantsciences.ucdavis.edu/) is an interactive website that provides customized, site-specific nitrogen (N) fertilizer recommendations for California small grain growers. It integrates spatial statewide weather and soil data with user-supplied, field-specific measurements in order to provide real-time N fertilizer recommendations.
